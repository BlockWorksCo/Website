I'm an experienced software engineer and architect with many years working with embedded, real-time and 
resource-constrained systems.
Domains I've worked in cover many industries from defense, smart-metering, IoT, GPS, signal processing
and mobile applications.

The intention here is to share some wisdom and best-practices that I've picked up over my years consulting
for the many clients I've worked for.

Though focussed on embedded/real-time work, I've also served my time on the server and desktop side(s)
to accompany the embedded devices.
No embedded-device lives on its own, they tend to naturally be one small part of larger systems and
I consider myself a systems-focussed engineer and architect, spreading my time across most disciplines
and the communication between them.
My technical knowledge is both broad and deep, allowing me to match up high-level abstractions with
low-level implementation details to produce a more optimal system.

As any complex system develops, the need for testing becomes paramount, especially as the scale of the
deployment rises. To that end, designing-for-test is an important aspect of my methodologies.
