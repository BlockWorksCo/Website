<p>Many devices these days are battery powered. Being battery powered requires that we create software to make
the most possible use of the battery.
Software for low-power devices behaves very differently to normal software in a few regards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spend most most of its time in low-power-mode (or even off).</li>
<li>Startup very quickly.</li>
<li>Shutdown very quickly.</li>
<li>Devices must be off by default and only turned on while used.</li>
<li>Power rails for devices must be under the control of the software.</li>
<li>Communicate as infrequently as possible.</li>
<li>Never busy-wait.</li>
<li>Enter low-power-mode in the idle task.</li>
<li>Interrupt driven.</li>
<li>Store as little as possible (storage devices are power hungry).</li>
<li>Store data in an appropriate manner (i.e. no filesystem).</li>
<li>Likely super-loop driven rather than being multi-threaded.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="architecting-for-low-power-operation">Architecting for low-power operation.</h1>

<p>Bearing in mind the above points, what does the typical low-power-software look like?</p>

<ul>
<li>99% of the time is spent in the deepest low-power-mode possible, generally with no RAM retention. This means
you&rsquo;re likely to be booting every time you want to do anything.</li>
<li>Triggered to wake up by an interrupt, probably from an external device such as an RTC or a button generating an edge
on a GPIO.</li>
<li>The startup code must first discover <em>why</em> it was woken up. From this it can determine the minimum amount of work that
needs to be performed. Note that this is <em>before</em> normal initialisation.</li>
<li>Initialise devices and drivers as needed for the current mode.</li>
<li>Perform business logic and respond to the event appropriate to the mode.</li>
<li>Store any required data in the most appropriate place (RAM?, EEPROM?, FLASH?)</li>
<li>Setup trigger events for the next wake-period.</li>
<li>Enter low-power-mode or turn off.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="application-level-design-for-low-power-systems">Application-level design for low-power systems</h1>

<ul>
<li>Asynchronous communication; allow the device to respond in <em>its</em> own time, not the servers.</li>
<li>Infrequent communication; Communication is generally power-hungry (i.e. radio)</li>
<li>Communication should be driven from device, rather than from server.</li>
<li>Event driven; software operations can be triggerred from timers, buttons, sensors, etc as well as internal events.</li>
<li>Minimal storage; there are tradeoffs to discuss here regarding whether to store data or transfer it off-device. There
are tradeoffs aplenty here.</li>
<li>Deterministic behaviour; Being predictable is important in order to be able to predict battery-life. This requires
a known current-draw from the system. Often, the charactersistics of batteries power-loss are not able to be monitored
so their life has to be predicted. This requires knowing <em>exactly</em> how the device behaves.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="trade-offs">Trade offs</h1>

<ul>
<li>Storage versus communication.</li>
<li>Deep-sleep versus startup/shutdown duration.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="radio-communications-and-low-power-software">Radio communications and low-power software.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Appropriate data rate for application.</li>
<li>Choice of protocol (ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, LoRAWAN, etc).</li>
<li>Topology; mesh versus star.</li>
<li>Routing complexity versus efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="common-patterns-that-are-inappropriate-for-low-power-software">Common patterns that are inappropriate for low-power software</h1>

<ul>
<li>Filesystems; over-generic and complex.</li>
<li>Concurrency; overhead of context-switching is wasted energy.</li>
<li>Abstractions; every wasted instruction is wasted energy. For example, monitor the call-stack depth to identify over-abstracted code.</li>
</ul>
