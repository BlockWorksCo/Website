      <description>Inherent complexity (a.k.a. Essential complexity)
Given a task to solve, the inherent complexity of the problem is a statement about how complex the problem is, not about how complex your solution to the problem is.
This is the complexity of the problem domain. You cannot do anything to change this.
Accidental complexity The accidental complexity of a task on the other hand is a statement about how much complexity your solution has added on top of the inherent complexity.</description>
