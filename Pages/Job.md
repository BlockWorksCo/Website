Job/Block
============

The simplest way to run remote builds & tests.

Job/Block is a very simple process running on a server monitoring a job queue waiting for things to do.
A job can be queued up for execution on a server by any user process such as version control scripts in order to
kick off builds & tests at specific times.

Job/Block is very simple, open and extensible and not limited to development tasks; any task can be queued up
for execution on the server.
