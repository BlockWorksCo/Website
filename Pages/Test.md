Test/Block
===========

What is it?
-----------

A set of libraries & tools for performing combinations of unit & system testing on embedded sytems.

System testing on embedded systems involves controlling & monitoring of external devices and test
equipment as well as driving software.
Rocket/Test provides a tool to allow easy development, management and running of system and unit tests
as part of day to day development and as a Continuous Integration (CI) system.

Reporting of test results can be performed in multiple ways:

 1. Printed test report (PDF/DOC).
 2. JUnit test report for integration into other systems.
 3. Live dashboard for keeping a team informed (intended for big screen display). Hooks for failure
notifications.

Why use it?
----------

* *Lightweight*; Rocket/Test is at its heart simply a standard python interpreter. Tests can be run 
standalone, completely seperately from Rocket/Test. Standard Python libraries are used to interface
with test equipment.

* *Automation*; If a task isn't automated, it wont be performed regularly. This is a necessity for
a continuous integration project setup.

* *Repeatability*; Demonstrates the stability of a system. 

* *Reporting*; Presenting clear, reliable reports about the status of a development project can provide
valuable feedback about true progress for planning & project management. This does presume a proper level
of test coverage and preferably a TDD process.
